title: Mixins
description: >
  You cannot use mixins on anything that uses native class syntax (e.g. components that import from '<code>'@glimmer/component'</code>').
  The migration strategy depends on your use case.
  If your app depends on an addon that uses mixins, it may be best to continue using classic components until the addon is Octane-ready.

  See '<a href="https://www.pzuraq.com/do-you-need-ember-object/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">'Do you need Ember Object?'</a>' for alternatives to mixins, which include utility functions, services, delegates, and class decorators.
