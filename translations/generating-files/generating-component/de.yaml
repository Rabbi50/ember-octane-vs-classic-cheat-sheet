title: Use an option to generate a component's JavaScript
description: >
  In classic Ember, '<code>'ember generate component'</code>' created three files: the template, a JavaScript file, and a test.
  In Octane, '<code>'ember generate component'</code>' skips creating the JavaScript file.
  If you want the backing JavaScript class as well, include the '<code>'-gc'</code>' option.
